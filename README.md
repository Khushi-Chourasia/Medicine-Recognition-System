# Medicine-Recognition-System
This Flask web application utilizes Google's Generative AI models to generate detailed medical descriptions for uploaded images. The project, which focuses on medical content generation, incorporates two key models: the Pro-Vision model for in-depth medical descriptions and the Pro model for additional content generation. Upon uploading an image, the application uses the Pro-Vision model to generate comprehensive medical descriptions, ensuring clinical accuracy. Additionally, a validation step with the Pro model ensures that the context is indeed related to the medical field. The user is provided with generated content on successful validation, while the interface prompts for a valid medical image otherwise. The project's user interaction includes uploading images through a simple web form, content generation based on the uploaded images, and a validation step to ensure medical relevance. To maintain security, the application loads the required Google API key from environment variables. Further improvements could involve enhanced error handling, a more user-friendly interface, and thorough documentation for future development and maintenance.
